# ATTiny85APU

it is fantasy chip created by AlexMush. it's software synth running on AVR ATTiny85 (and some other ATTiny series chips).

five pulse channels, two AY-like envelope generators and one noise generator, all with fine pitch control. pulse channels have duty control, and can have any of the pulse, one of the envelopes and noise enabled on them in any combination.

chip features low (15 kHz) output sample rate so be ready for some crust.

## effects

- `10xx`: **set wave (bit 0: tone, bit 1: noise, bit 2: envelope)**
- `11xx`: **set duty cycle (00-FF)**
- `12xx`: **set envelope shape (envelope channels only, 0-7)**
- `13xx`: **set envelope starting phase (lower byte)**
- `14xx`: **set envelope starting phase (higher byte)**
- `15xx`: **load low byte of noise generator LFSR feedback bits**
- `16xx`: **load high byte of noise generator LFSR feedback bits**
- `17xx`: **set envelope number (0 to 1)**
